# Gift Finder

Gift Finder is an app to help users get gift ideas.

## Usage

The main function of the application is the 'Find a Gift' page, which allows users to put in information about someone to find a gift for. Once the information is filled out a request is made to the DB to find similar people and gifts they liked to come up with a list of up to 10 gifts in order of the strength of the match.

In addition users may add new data to the DB via the 'Share a Gift' page, filling out information about themselves or someone they know and a gift they liked.

Finally, users may create an account and login to save records of gift requests they have made.

TODO: Eventually users will be able to quickly retry the same query using this saved history, though this function is currently incomplete.
